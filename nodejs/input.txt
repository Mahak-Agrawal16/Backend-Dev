My name is Mahak Agrawal. I am currently pursuing my studies in Computer Science, and I have a strong interest in software development and problem solving.
Over time, I have worked on different academic projects and assignments in areas such as Data Structures, Computer Networks, Microprocessors, and Programming with Java, Python, and JavaScript.
I enjoy writing clean and efficient code, and I am especially interested in backend development and learning how real-world systems work behind the scenes.
I have hands-on experience with Node.js, file handling, arrays, strings, and basic algorithms like searching and recursion.
I consider myself a quick learner, dedicated, and hardworking person. I like taking challenges because they help me grow both technically and personally.
My goal is to become a skilled software developer and work in an organization where I can contribute my knowledge while continuously learning new technologies.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I look forward to learning and growing with your team.
